          <h1>Interests</h1>
          <p>My research interests are driven by a single fundamental question:
          Are we alone in the Universe? To help answer this question, my work
          focuses on Mars, which may have once hosted life (maybe it still
          does). Geologic and mineralogical evidence suggests that liquid
          water flowed across the Martian surface billions of years ago. Today,
          however, Mars is cold and dry and the atmosphere cannot support
          liquid water. So, the atmosphere must have been much different in
          the past. The climate may have been Earth-like for a long time.
          I'd like to help us better understand what that past climate was
          like, how long it was habitable, and what caused it to change.</p>
